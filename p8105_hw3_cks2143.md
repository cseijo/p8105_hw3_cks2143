Solution to HW 3.

## Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

Observations are the levels of items in orders by user. There are
user/order variables, such as user ID, order ID, order day, and order
hour. There are also item variables, including name, aisle, department,
and some numeric codes.

**How many aisles, and which are most items from?**

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

**Make a plot\!**

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```

**Make a table\!**

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |

**Apples vs. ice cream\!**

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

| product\_name    |        0 |        1 |        2 |        3 |        4 |        5 |        6 |
| :--------------- | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: |

## Problem 2

**Load, tidy, and wrangle the accelerometer data.**

``` r
accel_df = 
  read_csv(
      "./data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    activity.1:activity.1440,
    names_to = "minute",
    names_prefix = "activity.",
    values_to = "activity_counts"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    day = factor(day, 
                 levels=c("Sunday","Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday")),
    minute = as.numeric(minute),
    weekday = 
      ifelse(day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), FALSE, TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  arrange(day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset includes five weeks of accelerometer data collected on a 63
year-old male who was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. It
contains 50400 observations and 6 variables. Variables in this dataset
include week of observation, each day of observation, day of the week,
minute of the day, activity counts, and whether each observation
happened on a weekday or weekend.

**Total activity by day**

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  summarize(total_activity = sum(activity_counts)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'week' (override with `.groups` argument)

| week | day       | total\_activity |
| ---: | :-------- | --------------: |
|    1 | Sunday    |       631105.00 |
|    1 | Monday    |        78828.07 |
|    1 | Tuesday   |       307094.24 |
|    1 | Wednesday |       340115.01 |
|    1 | Thursday  |       355923.64 |
|    1 | Friday    |       480542.62 |
|    1 | Saturday  |       376254.00 |
|    2 | Sunday    |       422018.00 |
|    2 | Monday    |       295431.00 |
|    2 | Tuesday   |       423245.00 |
|    2 | Wednesday |       440962.00 |
|    2 | Thursday  |       474048.00 |
|    2 | Friday    |       568839.00 |
|    2 | Saturday  |       607175.00 |
|    3 | Sunday    |       467052.00 |
|    3 | Monday    |       685910.00 |
|    3 | Tuesday   |       381507.00 |
|    3 | Wednesday |       468869.00 |
|    3 | Thursday  |       371230.00 |
|    3 | Friday    |       467420.00 |
|    3 | Saturday  |       382928.00 |
|    4 | Sunday    |       260617.00 |
|    4 | Monday    |       409450.00 |
|    4 | Tuesday   |       319568.00 |
|    4 | Wednesday |       434460.00 |
|    4 | Thursday  |       340291.00 |
|    4 | Friday    |       154049.00 |
|    4 | Saturday  |         1440.00 |
|    5 | Sunday    |       138421.00 |
|    5 | Monday    |       389080.00 |
|    5 | Tuesday   |       367824.00 |
|    5 | Wednesday |       445366.00 |
|    5 | Thursday  |       549658.00 |
|    5 | Friday    |       620860.00 |
|    5 | Saturday  |         1440.00 |

This man appears to have noticeable dips in activity on the last two
Saturdays of observation. Activity counts also seem to be steady
throughout the week and fluctuate more often at the end of the week.

**Plot of total activity by day**

``` r
accel_df %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = activity_counts)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = day), alpha = .5)
```

![](p8105_hw3_cks2143_files/figure-gfm/accel_plot-1.png)<!-- -->

Based on this graph, we can conclude that there is noticeably less
activity during the night, and more activity during the day, with more
spikes recorded in the morning/evening.

## Problem 3

``` r
data("ny_noaa")
```

In the NY NOAA dataset, there are 7 columns and 2595176 rows. This
dataset includes weather data from New York state weather stations, with
the variables weather station ID, date of observation, precipitation
measured in tenths of mm, snowfall and snow depth in mm, and maximum and
minimum temperature in tenths of degrees C.

There are a total of 145,838 missing values in the precipitation
variable, 381,221 in snowfall, 591,786 in snow depth, 1,134,358 in
maximum temperature, and 1,134,420 in minimum temperature.

**Cleaning the data.**

``` r
noaa_df =
  ny_noaa %>%
  separate(date, c("year", "month", "day")) %>%
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year),
    month = as.numeric(month),
    day = as.numeric(day),
    prcp = as.numeric(prcp)*0.1,
    tmax = as.numeric(tmax)*0.1,
    tmin = as.numeric(tmin)*0.1
  )
```

For snow, the most commonly observed value is 0 at 2008508 observations.

summarize; filter january and july; then plot)

contour plot or bin plot; second plot - filter first, box plot or ridge
plot)
